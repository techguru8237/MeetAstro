The scene opens with Astro, a quirky robot with glowing eyes, sprinting into a dimly lit cave.
Suddenly, he stops, catches his breath and realizes you're there, and turns toward you.
Astro: (excitedly) "Hey there! I’m Astro, your personal 3D AI Bot. I bring together AI, gaming,
entertainment, and decentralized finance (DeFi) into one awesome experience!"
Who are you? Type it in the chatbox below!"
(The chatbox appears on screen, prompting the player to enter their name.)
Astro: (after receiving input) "[Player’s name], huh? Nice name! With a name like that I think I
trust you already, here take this.
(Astro tries to hand the player a ‘Test Bitcoin’)
I found this outside but.. Oh shoot you don't have a wallet.. Let me put this in my wallet for now..
(Wallet icon pulses and the player clicks on it and shows the balance of 1 ‘Test Bitcoin’)
Astro: Alright, now that we’re besties, let’s talk. See this chatbox? It’s not just for
introductions—you’ll use it to talk to me. Try it, ask me anything that's on your mind?
(Player asks question and Astro answers Via API AI)
See I'm very smart but that's not all, click 'Play with Astro' and pick any of the actions and watch
me do cool stuff!
(Player clicks 'Play with Astro' and Astro performs the action chosen)
Astro: (laughing) "See? I’m very obedient… sometimes. Now, let's try typing one of my actions
in the chatbox. Type 'run' and I’ll show you how fast I am!"
(Player types 'run', and Astro zips across the screen before returning.)
Astro: "Cool, right? I’ve got moves. Speaking of moves, I’ve got to show you something really
cool. Let’s head over to this side of the cave!"
Scene 2: Swap ATM
Astro walks over to the glowing machine labeled "Swap ATM." It hums softly with digital lights
flickering on its surface.
Astro: "Ta-da! This is the Swap ATM. Here, you can swap crypto tokens like BTC and Ethereum
using CWAP. Psst It's much cheaper than all the other swaps you know of ;).
Astro: Remember the ‘Test Bitcoin’ I was going to give you earlier, well, let's use that. Ready to
learn how it works?"
(Chatbox lights up and Player is encouraged to type ‘Yes’)
(A DEX like pop-up slides up from the bottom of the screen, just above the chatbox)
(The DEX pops up and Astro is peaking his head over the DEX which has been animated with
his eyes looking below, around and back at you in an intriguing way. A 1 0 sec video on loop until
the DEX pop up disappears).

Missions tutorial
User: Clicks on the Mission Bar as it will be pulsing when Missions become available.
Astro: Welcome to the Daily missions arena.(Play Mission Impossible Theme song in
background for 6 seconds while Astro puts on mission impossible glasses). You can send me on
missions to go and collect rewards such as tokens, XP and gems outside the cave. Sometimes I
come back with A LOT and other times not so much..
Astro: But remember most of my missions take 'x' amount of time so make sure you don't need
more for any tasks.. But if you need me back in a hurry you can always spend 'x' amount of
gems to bring me back quicker with the rewards.. Who knows what I'll find!
Missions
Astro can be sent on ‘Missions’ for a set cost of gems, which is the in-game currency. These
missions allow Astro to venture out of the cave for a certain duration, represented by a
countdown timer.
If you want Astro to return early, you can pay a fee to bring him back. This creates a dynamic
similar to a pack-opening experience.
Why send Astro on Missions?
Astro could return with:
● A LOT of tokens, average tokens or fewer tokens
● Big rewards or small rewards
● (No NFTs here)
Each mission holds the potential for surprises, making every adventure exciting and rewarding.

More in depth about the features
Swap ATM
The Swap ATM allows you to effortlessly swap one token for another, regardless of the
blockchain or token type. It delivers a seamless and intuitive experience like never before.
For example, simply type:
“Hey Astro, trade $1 00 of my BTC to ETH please.”
Astro will:
• Find you the best available rates.
• Provide a detailed overview of the trade.
All you need to do is sign to approve the transaction.
And during this process? You’ll witness something truly groundbreaking – but I’ll save that
surprise for another time.
Yield Generator
Is your crypto, like ETH, just sitting idle in your wallet? Let Astro put it to work and maximize
your returns.
Simply type or interact with the Yield Generator:
“Hey Astro, find me the best yield to stake my ETH.”
Or head over to the Yield Generator Machine and activate it directly.
Astro will ask for what you would like to and deliver the best staking opportunities tailored to
your needs.
4% Deposit, 8% Deposit, 9.99% Borrow
This feature will require both UI/UX development and backend integration. The AI will need to
analyze blockchains and projects to identify the best yield options tailored to users' risk
preferences and selected tokens.
Trading
You can put in trades by just asking ‘Astro’
E.g Hey Astro can you buy Bitcoin if it hits 60K. Astro will then get you to confirm in your wallet
and then the trade is live. You will be able to see any live trades on the UI/UX on the left hand
side near chat history.
You can cancel the trades at any time.
Dumb Money
Looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities?
Ask Astro to scan all blockchains and social media to uncover projects with the potential to
become the next “Doge.”
Set your risk limit, review the findings, and decide if you’re ready to make your next move.
This feature will require UI/UX development alongside backend integration. The AI will need to
search blockchains and projects to identify the best meme tokens/ risker plays. Additionally, it
will scrape Twitter/X to collect data to give the user a breakdown of what is going on. E.g how
many tweets, if its verified accounts, if the team is unknown or now, market cap and so on and
present users with curated options based on their preferred risk levels.
Missions
Astro can be sent on ‘Missions’ for a set cost, which could be an in-game currency cost (to be
determined). These missions allow Astro to venture out of the cave for a certain duration,
represented by a countdown timer.
If you want Astro to return early, you can pay a fee to bring him back. This creates a dynamic
similar to a pack-opening experience.
Why send Astro on Missions?
Astro could return with:
● A LOT of tokens, average tokens or fewer tokens
● NFTs
● Big rewards or small rewards
● Quest items
Each mission holds the potential for surprises, making every adventure exciting and rewarding.
The feature will require UI/UX design and a countdown timer. When Astro embarks on a
mission, he will visually exit the cave and then disappear, with the process primarily handled
through UI/UX elements. The rewards and items Astro brings back will be randomized upon his
return.
Missions will have a participation cost, but users will receive rewards in return. Additionally,
there will need to be a bag/inventory system (similar to World of Warcraft) for Astro to carry
and store the items he retrieves. This inventory will allow users to view and manage the items.
Also this is where we need to add in like,comment, retweet to complete the mission. We will
need to be able to add this manually every day on the backend to update to the new tweet for
them to gain ‘x’ amount of in-game currency.
Revenue Distribution
- A portion or all of the revenue will be allocated to a pool. Once the pool reaches a
certain threshold, the funds will be distributed randomly to participants who have used
the protocol machines.
- One idea being considered is using the pool to buy CWEB off the market and distribute
it. Unknown at this stage.
Revenue generated by the protocol, such as fees from the 'Swap ATM,' will be deposited into a
separate wallet. The UI/UX will require a clean and intuitive design to display a counter at the
top of the interface somewhere for all users to see. This counter will increment in real-time
whenever funds are added/removed to the wallet. Additionally, a trigger mechanism will be
implemented to distribute rewards when certain events occur, such as the completion of a
mission where users earn rewards.
Levelling system
Every user will have access to the features and can earn XP by engaging with specific activities,
which will help level Astro up. Astro's levels will range from 1 to 60 at the start.
You can earn XP by completing ‘Missions’ and using the ‘Swap ATM’. (Additional XP-earning
activities will be introduced in the future.)
Looking at an idea that at a certain level Astro becomes ‘A real BOY’ (NFT) than tradable on
marketplace as there is a benefit to a high level Astro:
- Huge discounts on all trades
- Bigger rewards
- Special perks
- Higher % APY on stakes assets.
- + more
Speaks for itself but needs a level guide just when you click on the level bar at top right
explaining what rewards you get at which level.
